# Photo_to_text_app_using_tesseract_tkinter
A simple Tkinter application which uses Tesseract to convert Photo to Txt file.


This simple python script launches a tkinter application which converts photo to text using Tesseract OCR and then saves the text as a txt file.

In order to run you have to import pytesseract library and tesseract (using brew command for mac).

For language options, I have included Turkish and English but it can be added more.

Only .png and .jpg images work.

For usage in windows, the path of the exe file must be provided to tesseract but not included in my code.
